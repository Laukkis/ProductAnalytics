# Prodcut Analytics Course
This repo contains scripts for analyzing data from course assignments

## How to get started

```
git clone
download necessary dependencies
cd to problem folder
python calculations.py
python t-samples.py
```
Results are printed to console

### Disclaimers
These are the first experiments with Python, so not necessarily the best solutions, but they work


### TODO

Finnish results saving to own excel. Now partly done
